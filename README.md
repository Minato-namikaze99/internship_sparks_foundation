This is a repository I made to host my Notebook of a project which predicts the score of a student based on the number of hours he/she studies using Linear Regression in Jupyter. 
As it is clearly shown in the Notebook, the model gives us a pretty accurate data.The accuracy of the data can be increased to a greater level with the help of more data and the model will get more and more accurate with more and more data.
